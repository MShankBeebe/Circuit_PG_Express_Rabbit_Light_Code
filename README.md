# Ciruit_PG_Express_Rabbit_Light_Code
 A program to make a softly changing rainbow light.  I based my code on Carter Nelson's code Circuit Playground Bike Light - Round N Round

Carter Nelson's code has a fixed rainbow that appears one LED at a time until it completes the circle and then disappears to start over.

My code lights up one LED to a color at a time.  Once there as a complete circle of one color, it starts to light up one LED at a time with a new color.  This creates a softly changing rainbow light.  In order to diffuse the light and make it easier to see, I put the Circuit Playground Express inside a silicone coin purse.
